### Have ChatGPT generate a reference sheet for Github CLI commands. Consider how you want this data organized to generate the most value.

#### Prompt 1:

<blockquote>
What are best practices when using Github CLI?
</blockquote>

#### Output:
<blockquote>
Using GitHub CLI (Command Line Interface) can streamline your interactions with GitHub repositories and enhance your workflow. Here are some best practices when using GitHub CLI:

Installation:
Ensure that you have GitHub CLI installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official GitHub CLI repository or use package managers like Homebrew, Chocolatey, or others, depending on your operating system.

Authentication:
Authenticate GitHub CLI with your GitHub account using gh auth login. This will securely store your credentials, making it easier to interact with repositories without having to log in repeatedly.

Repository Cloning:
Clone repositories using gh repo clone <repository> to create a local copy of the repository on your machine. This simplifies collaboration and allows you to work on projects offline.

Branch Management:

Create new branches using gh repo create <branch-name> or switch to an existing branch using gh repo fork <repository> and gh repo fork clone <repository>.
Use gh repo view --branch <branch-name> to view a specific branch on GitHub without switching locally.
Pull Requests:

Create pull requests with gh pr create. This command opens an interactive prompt to guide you through the process, including selecting the base and head branches.
Use gh pr status to check the status of your pull requests.
Code Reviews:

View and review pull requests using gh pr list and gh pr checkout <pull-request-number>.
Add comments or approve changes using gh pr review.
Merging Changes:

Merge pull requests with gh pr merge <pull-request-number>.
Choose the appropriate merge strategy (e.g., --merge or --squash).
Repository Information:

Retrieve information about a repository with gh repo view.
Use gh repo list to see a list of repositories you have access to.
Repository Creation:

Create a new repository with gh repo create.
Use the --public or --private flag to set the repository visibility.
Workflow Automation:

Automate repetitive tasks using scripts and GitHub CLI commands.
Integrate GitHub CLI into your CI/CD pipelines for seamless automation.
Update GitHub CLI:
Regularly update GitHub CLI to access new features, improvements, and bug fixes.

Documentation:
Familiarize yourself with the GitHub CLI documentation to discover additional features and options.

By following these best practices, you can enhance your efficiency and collaboration when working with GitHub repositories using the GitHub CLI.

#### Prompt 2:

<blockquote>
Role:  You are a manager and principal engineer at a software tech company.
Task:  Your goal is to write out succinct best practice guidelines for new hires that are brief, easy to understand, and important to remember.  You need to ensure that the following:
1. They understand the importance behind working off of a fork of a repo instead of the source repo.
2. They understand the difference between a fork which is remote, and a clone of the fork, which is on their local machine.
3. They can think of the Github work flow in three phases:  Setting up a project, Creating changes within a project, and drafting & reviewing changes in a pull request.
4. They understand that setting up a project consists of Forking, Cloning and setting remote origins (named "origin" for their forked repository, and named "upstream" for the source repository), and that this phase only needs to happen once.
5. They understand the workflow pattern of the Creating Changes phase and memorize the workflow pattern of switching branches, adding changes, committing changes, pushing changes, creating pull a request, and squashing multiple commits if they have more than one commit.  They should know to push their changes to a similarly named branch on their forked repository which should be linked within the github config as their "origin" remote url.
6.  They understand the importance of squashing commits is so that reviewers can easily review all of their changes, and that best practice for squashing commits is to rebase and force push.
7.  They understand that once they've pushed changes that they can create a Pull Request through the URL generated in their terminal by the Github CLI, and that they should request a review.  They should be reminded at this point to squash multiple commits if they have more than one commit.
Background:  Your target audience consists of young, junior engineers at the beginning of their careers without a lot of experience working in teams.  
Output:  Please provide detailed methods and specific implementation steps in the form of a table with the headers, "Phase," "Implementation Steps," "Objectives," "Reminders," "Warnings"
Example: "Phase": "Creating Changes", "Implenentation Step": "Step 1:  Switch to a new branch using 'git checkout -b `branch-name`', "Objectives": "Before making any changes, switch to a new branch and give it a name that follows the team's standards and best practices.  In our case, the branch name should include your github username, the type of change you are creating (major, minor, patch), and a brief description of what you are trying to accomplish.," "Reminders": "The purpose of switching branches is to practice change control, and to prevent change conflicts on shared branches.  If you forget this step before making changes, you can leave the current branch unaffected and ensure that changes are made to a new branch as long as you checkout to a new branch before making a commit. " "Warning:" "If you forget to switch to a new branch before commiting, you run the risk of desyncing from the source project's branch history.  You may run into issues where you are prevented from pushing your changes because your branch is ahead or behind the primary branch history."
